        "Depression - Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment Options \n\n"

        "Depression is a serious mental illness that can significantly impair a person's quality"
        "of life. The causes of depression are complex and may include genetic, biological,"
        "psychological, and social factors. Symptoms of depression include deep sadness, loss of"
        "interest, exhaustion, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, and negative thoughts.\n"

        "Cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the most effective treatment options for depression."
        "It is based on the premise that negative thoughts and behavior patterns contribute to "
        "the development and maintenance of depression. Through therapy, patients learn to identify"
        "and correct their distorted thinking, replace negative thoughts with more realistic ones,"
        "and develop new, positive behavior patterns.\n"

        "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based therapy that is"
        "based on the assumption that thoughts, emotions, and behavior patterns"

        "maintenance of mental disorders. \n"

        "In the context of CBT, patients are supported in identifying and correcting"
        "their cognitive distortions, replacing negative thoughts with more realistic "
        "ones, and developing new positive behavioral patterns. This therapy is"
        "effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-"
        "compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and many other mental illnesses. \n"
